\section*{Abstract}
The McKibben pneumatic actuator is an actuator that contracts when compressed air is applied and generates tension in its own axial direction.
Recently, thin MPAs with diameters of a few millimeters have been attracting attention. Recently, thin MPAs with diameters of a few millimeters have been attracting attention. On the other hand, if we consider the application of MPAs to highly integrated, small animal or insect-like robots, the current McKibben-type MPAs are not suitable for such applications.
The current McKibben-type artificial muscles are difficult to fabricate with an inner diameter of 3 mm or smaller, so there is a need for the development of smaller diameter artificial muscles. In this study, we are developing an ultra-small pneumatic artificial muscle with a relatively simple structure using an axial fiber-reinforced type artificial muscle.
In this paper, based on the know-how of balloon fabrication, we fabricated axial fiber-reinforced artificial muscles with inner diameters of 5 mm and 3 mm, and confirmed the contraction rate and exerted tension.
