The McKibben pneumatic actuator (MPA) is an actuator that contracts when compressed air is applied to it, generating tension in its own axial direction.
Recently, thin MPAs with a diameter of a few millimeters have been attracting attention, and their application to musculoskeletal and bio-mimetic robots has been popular because they can reproduce not only small muscles but also complex muscles by integration.
The application of MPAs to musculoskeletal and biomimetic robots is flourishing. The smallest diameter MPAs currently available on the market are those with a diameter of about 3 mm.
On the other hand, the development of even smaller diameter artificial muscles is required for further integration and application to very small robots such as small animals and insects. In this study, we focus on axial fiber-reinforced artificial muscles, which have a relatively simple structure, and aim to develop even thinner ultra-thin pneumatic artificial muscles.
This paper describes the development of a liquid lathe. In this paper, we develop a method to fabricate axial fiber-reinforced artificial muscles with inner diameters of 5 mm and 3 mm, based on our expertise in balloon fabrication using liquid latex.
The shrinkage rate and exerted tension were confirmed through experiments.
